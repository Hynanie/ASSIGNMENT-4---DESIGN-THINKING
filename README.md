# REFLECTION⋆.˚ ᡣ𐭩 .𖥔˚

My goal in developing eduTrack is to help students keep up with their educations such as
academic evaluation, financial issues,tracking attendance, etc. This will not only benefit the
student but also for the lecturers and parents who are constantly worried about their student’s
progress. Design thinking has helped me in organizing my thoughts and ideas about the project.It
helped me view the problem and solve it through being empathetic with users, brainstorming all
the possible solutions and creating a prototype for it. This method has helped us create eduTrack
with the best kind of services as we could. Our eduTrack are occupied with features like Grade
Tracker, Goal Setting, and Progress Monitoring will definitely be a huge help towards our
targeted audience. My plans that I think are necessary to enhance our potential in the industry is
to establish a community forum or discussion board within eduTrack, fostering a sense of
belonging and allowing users to share experiences, tips, and advice.

To enhance the project,we could consider implementing a user feedback system, ensuring mobile accessibility, and integrating with educational resources. Incorporating a robust notification system, predictive analytics for academic insights, and gamification elements can further engage students. Prioritize security measures and privacy to build trust among users. Accessibility features and collaboration tools will contribute to inclusivity and community building.
